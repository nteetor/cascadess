# cascadess (development version)

* The CSS styles applied by the package are now consistent with those applied by
  the Bootstrap framework.
* The package is now intended to mesh well with {bslib} and other
  Bootstrap-based {shiny} packages.
* A number of functions have been renamed to increase the clarity of their
  purpose and effect, e.g. `background()` to `background_color()`.
* Additionally, a few functions have been broken into multiple functions.
